title: Write a README.md
desc: |-
  The README should contain:
  
    * A friendly bio of moxie.
    * A note about installing, testing, and using:
  
      $ ./setup install
      $ moxie-test
      $ moxie-static
  
    * And something for the developers:
  
      $ virtualenv moxie
      $ git clone git://github.com/quad/moxie.git moxie/src
      $ cd moxie/src
      $ ./setup develop
  
    * And maybe a link to a demo moxie? http://mixtape.quadhome.com/
