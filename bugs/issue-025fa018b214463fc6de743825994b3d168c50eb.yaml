title: An announce feature!
desc: |-
  There should be a very simple command to announce new moxies.
  
    $ moxie-announce http://blah.com/
  
  It pulls either the page or xspf (or both). Does appropriate scraping for the
  titles, length, and other fun.
  
  Then pops up an editor with a proposed headline.
  
  When done, it e-mails to post@posterous.com from moxie@quadhome.com.
