title: Figure out deployment scenarios.
desc: |-
  I would prefer two deployment scenarios:
  
    1. CGI script.
    2. Static directory.
  
  Other options include the various other WSGI mechanisms. But, I figure the CGI
  script method is a failure case of this.
  
  We presume we're a full setup.py installed instance in all situations.
  
  == CGI Script ==
  
    $ moxie
  
  This means the "develop" mode needs to be fixed. (See {issue 8d5c5881d02218a45724cf4a049ce62f6fd018b2})
  
  The MP3s come from, in order of priority:
  
    1. Working directory.
    2. Environment variable "MOXIE_DIR"
  
  == Static Directory ==
  
    $ moxie -o ~/public_html/mixtape ~/music/1
  
  The "-o" argument should be short for "--output". This is the directory to which the files are written.
  
  We should work on music in the specified directory.
  
    * This music is copied to the output directory.
    * The index.html, XSPF, and RSS are all wrote out.
    * All the static files are dropped into static/
  
  It would be nice to share static/ between multiple mixtapes. But, that's version 2.
