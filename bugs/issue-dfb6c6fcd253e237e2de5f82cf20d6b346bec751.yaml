    Testing with Sarah and Tom indicates the Flash -> Browser FFI is working.
    
    And, our event binding is all working.
    
    I changed over the Browser -> Flash FFI to MusicPlayer_*. There are whispering on the Internet that this will have a positive effect.
    
    It doesn't immediately, because I think jQuery is giving back the wrong handle
    to the player's DOM reference.
    
    I switched the handle retrieval to using swfobject's API.
    
    Now, I wait to see if these changes close the IE issue.
