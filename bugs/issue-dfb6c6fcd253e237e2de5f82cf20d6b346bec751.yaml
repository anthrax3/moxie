    Testing with Sarah and Tom indicates the Flash -> Browser FFI is working.
    
    And, our event binding is all working.
    
    I changed over the Browser -> Flash FFI to MusicPlayer_*. There are whispering on the Internet that this will have a positive effect.
    
    It doesn't immediately, because I think jQuery is giving back the wrong handle
    to the player's DOM reference.
    
    I switched the handle retrieval to using swfobject's API.
    
    Now, I wait to see if these changes close the IE issue.

    All the solutions ended up being necessary. To summarize:
    
    Problem: jQuery wasn't giving a handle to the Flash DOM object.
    Solution: Use swfobject's API.
    
    Problem: IE prevents binding .play / .stop
    Solution: Ghetto namespacing by prefixing "MusicPlayer_"
    
    Problem: IE doesn't support .currentTarget
    Solution: var target = event.currentTarget || event.srcElement;
