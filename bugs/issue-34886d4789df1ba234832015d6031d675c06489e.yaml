title: Highlight the background of the currently playing track.
desc: |-
  We have hightlight on selection.
  
  But, there should be a latent highlight on the currently playing track.
  
  In fact, this should be client-side as opposed to the playback which is flash-side. That way there is an immediate UI response for the user.
